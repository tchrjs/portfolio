Getting a [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) (PWA) to feel like a native app can be often be difficult. Sometimes it looks right in the browser but not as a PWA, and other times it’s the other way around. On top of that, you also have to consider how the website is handled by different browsers as well.
