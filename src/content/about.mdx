I'm a passionate programmer, a digitial artist, and a software developer from Las Vegas, Nevada.
I have strong drive to create and build meaningful products.\
\
I'm currently working as a full-time game developer at [Pervasive Gaming](https://pervasivegaming.com/).
I develop the front-end side of Reel and Keno games, working along side a team of other developers, artists, and animators.\
\
I'm open to new software developer positions from part-time to contract work.
I also would appreciate any mentorship as well to further hone and improve my skills!\

Feel free to check out the projects I have worked on, and check out my blog where I go over subjects I love to learn as well!
